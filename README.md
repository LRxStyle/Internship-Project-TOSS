This project that I have created for my internship project started at 20 July 2023. 
The project I and the IT Chief at PAS agreed is to make Input Data TOSS screen(17 July), then I started my internship at 1 August 2023. 
During the gap I already started doing my project before I officially started my internship. 
When I started my internship I solely doing everything alone. 
From the design, the algorithm, constructing communication route with database. 
Then later on my 2nd week(8 August 2023) I have been told to create 2 more screen(Table Data TOSS & Edit Data TOSS) outside of our agreement.

This app consist of 4 page or screen :
- Input Data TOSS 
- Table Data TOSS
